## Professional Mentorship Group

This mentorship group is designed for licensed healthcare providers — including NDs, DCs, MDs, DOs, NPs, PA-Cs, LAc.s, and others — who are interested in discussing clinical cases and deepening their understanding of systems-based and network-oriented approaches to health.

We will explore how to interpret and work with complex patient presentations through a systems biology lens, drawing on both traditional and modern frameworks. The format emphasizes collaborative learning, case-based discussion, and practical clinical insight.
