# Paul Kalnins, ND, MS  
Independent Researcher in Systems & Network Physiology\
Biomedical Data Scientist | Computational Biologist


## Research Profile   
I am an independent researcher and naturopathic physician working at the intersection of systems biology, network physiology, and clinical informatics. My work focuses on integrating electronic health record (EHR) data, wearable-derived physiological signals, and clinical biomarkers to develop multi-organ models of resilience, chronic disease, and recovery.

I recently completed a National Library of Medicine (NLM) postdoctoral fellowship in bioinformatics and computational biomedicine at Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU), where I developed interpretable machine learning pipelines for multimodal health data, digital biomarker discovery, and systems-level prediction of metabolic and inflammatory risk.

My broader research interests center on translating complexity science into clinically meaningful frameworks for whole-person care, with emphasis on organ-level networks, autonomic regulation, and longitudinal physiological coherence. My clinical background informs this work by grounding computational models in real-world patient trajectories and multi-system presentations.
