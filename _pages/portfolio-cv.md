# Paul Kalnins, ND, MS  
Healthcare Analytics • Clinical Data • Clinical Informatics


## Professional Profile   

Healthcare analytics and clinical data professional with a background spanning clinical medicine, physiology, and computational analysis. My work focuses on longitudinal healthcare data, interpretable modeling approaches, and the analysis of real-world clinical datasets.

I completed a National Library of Medicine (NLM) postdoctoral fellowship in bioinformatics and computational biomedicine at Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU), where I worked with multimodal health data, predictive modeling workflows, and physiological data analysis. My analytical interests center on extracting meaningful signal from complex clinical and physiological datasets, with emphasis on interpretable and decision-focused methods.

My prior clinical and academic experience informs this work by providing domain expertise in physiology, clinical variability, and healthcare data-generating processes.


## Analytical & Research Interests
- Longitudinal and time-dependent patterns in clinical data
- Healthcare and EHR-based data analysis
- Physiological and wearable-derived data interpretation
- Multimodal healthcare datasets (clinical, laboratory, digital health)
- Quantitative approaches to metabolic and chronic disease dynamics
