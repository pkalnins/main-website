## Research
My research focuses on applying systems science, network physiology, and biomedical data analytics to better understand health, resilience, and chronic disease across interconnected biological systems.

I am particularly interested in developing computational and clinically grounded models that move beyond single-variable risk factors toward multi-organ, longitudinal representations of physiological function. This work integrates electronic health record (EHR) data, wearable-derived metrics, and clinical biomarkers to explore how patterns of regulation and coherence emerge across biological scales.


## Current Research Themes
### Network Physiology & Organ-Level Modeling
Developing frameworks that treat organ systems as interacting nodes within dynamic physiological networks, with the goal of identifying patterns of vulnerability and resilience that inform prevention and personalized care.

### Clinical Informatics & EHR-Based Systems Analysis
Building pipelines for extracting structured and unstructured clinical data to support retrospective cohort analysis, longitudinal modeling, and systems-level phenotype discovery.

### Digital Health & Wearable Analytics
Exploring how heart rate variability, stress metrics, sleep parameters, and other wearable-derived signals can be integrated with clinical data to characterize autonomic-metabolic coupling and regulatory balance.

### Systems Approaches to Metabolic and Inflammatory Disease
Applying network-based methods to conditions such as type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome, with emphasis on multimorbidity, organ crosstalk, and resilience rather than isolated endpoints.


## Ongoing Projects
- Development of a privacy-preserving EHR analytics pipeline for integrative medicine research
- Organ-network modeling of metabolic risk and physiological resilience
- Integration of wearable autonomic metrics with clinical biomarkers for systems-level prediction

(Additional project details forthcoming.)


## Collaboration
I welcome collaboration with clinicians, researchers, and organizations interested in systems medicine, clinical informatics, and network-based approaches to health.

My work spans conceptual modeling, data engineering, statistical analysis, and translational interpretation. Collaborative projects may include retrospective EHR studies, digital health analytics, methodological development, or systems-oriented clinical research.
