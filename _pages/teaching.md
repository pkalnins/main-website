## Teaching & Professional Education

I offer small-group, case-based teaching for licensed healthcare providers interested in systems-oriented and network-based approaches to clinical care.

My teaching integrates clinical experience, systems biology, and network physiology to help practitioners work more effectively with complex, multi-system presentations. Rather than focusing solely on isolated diagnoses or protocols, we emphasize pattern recognition, organ-system interactions, and longitudinal regulation — supporting participants in developing a deeper, systems-level clinical intuition.

This educational work also informs my research, creating a bidirectional exchange between real-world clinical experience and computational modeling.

## Professional Case-Based Learning Group
This ongoing small-group program is designed for licensed healthcare providers — including NDs, DCs, MDs, DOs, NPs, PA-Cs, LAc.s, and others — who wish to deepen their understanding of complex chronic illness through a systems biology lens.

Sessions focus on collaborative case discussion, integrative interpretation of labs and clinical histories, and practical application of network-oriented frameworks. Participants are encouraged to bring challenging cases and engage in shared inquiry around physiological patterns, resilience, and multi-organ dynamics.

Areas of emphasis include:
- Systems approaches to chronic and multimorbid conditions
- Organ-level network interactions
- Clinical pattern recognition across biological systems
- Integration of conventional diagnostics with whole-person frameworks
- Translating systems thinking into practical treatment strategies

If there is room in the group, you’ll receive a secure Stripe payment link and Zoom access details. Otherwise, you'll be added to the waitlist and I'll let you know when there is an opening.  

## Open Educational Resources
I have also made available a large archive of recorded lectures from my time teaching at the National University of Natural Medicine (NUNM), covering topics including physiology, endocrinology, pathology, and integrative clinical reasoning.

These videos were originally created for graduate-level medical education and remain freely accessible as a resource for clinicians, students, and researchers interested in systems-oriented approaches to health.
