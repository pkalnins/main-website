## Telehealth Services

I offer telemedicine (video or phone) consultations for individuals seeking **naturopathic and integrative healthcare**.  

- While I have previously provided primary care, my current services are best used **in collaboration with your existing medical providers** as a complementary layer of support.

- I draw from both modern biomedical research and traditional systems of medicine to help you address patterns of dysfunction across multiple physiological systems.  

- My focus includes the **endocrine (hormonal)**, **nervous**, **immune**, and **organ** systems.

- I use a wide range of toolsâ€”including **nutrition**, **micronutrient therapies** (vitamins, minerals, amino acids, fatty acids), **herbal medicine**, and when appropriate, **conventional therapies** such as hormone replacement.

- My approach is based on a **salutogenic** (health-generating) model that aims to restore coherence and resilience across your bodyâ€™s interconnected systems.
