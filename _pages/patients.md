## Telehealth Services

I offer telemedicine (video or phone) consultations for individuals seeking integrative healthcare.  

My practice emphasizes **naturopathic and integrative specialty care**.  
While I have previously provided primary care, my current services are best used **in collaboration with your existing medical providers** as a complementary layer of support.

## Practice Philosophy

### Salutogenic, Whole-Systems Medicine

I draw from both modern biomedical research and traditional systems of medicine to help you address patterns of dysfunction across multiple physiological systems.  

My focus includes the **endocrine (hormonal)**, **nervous**, **immune**, and **organ** systems.

I use a wide range of toolsâ€”including **nutrition**, **micronutrient therapies** (vitamins, minerals, amino acids, fatty acids), **herbal medicine**, and when appropriate, **conventional therapies** such as hormone replacement.

My approach is based on a **salutogenic** (health-generating) model that aims to restore coherence and resilience across your bodyâ€™s interconnected systems.

### What is Naturopathic Medicine?

Naturopathic medicine is a distinct healthcare profession focused on prevention and the body's self-healing capacity.  
It integrates **modern science**, **clinical expertise**, and **natural therapies** to restore health and address underlying causes of disease.

### What is a Naturopathic Doctor?

Naturopathic doctors (NDs) are trained in **accredited four-year medical schools**, where they study both conventional medical sciences and evidence-based natural medicine.

They develop personalized treatment plans, aiming to **identify and address root causes**, and follow the **Therapeutic Orderâ„¢**â€”a framework for using the least invasive therapies first, escalating only as needed.

---

### Do you offer primary care?

My practice is **not a replacement for conventional primary care**. I recommend all clients remain established with a primary care provider for routine screenings, immunizations, and acute care.

For Oregon residents, I can:

For clients **outside of Oregon**, I serve as a **health and wellness consultant** and do not diagnose, treat, or prescribe medications.
