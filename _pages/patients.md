## Systems-Based Integrative Care

I provide consultative telehealth services for individuals seeking a systems-oriented approach to chronic and complex health concerns.

While I previously offered primary care, my current practice is designed to complement your existing medical providers, adding a layer of integrative and physiological systems analysis.

My clinical work draws from modern biomedical research, network physiology, and traditional medical frameworks to help identify patterns of dysfunction across interconnected biological systems — including endocrine, nervous, immune, and organ networks.

Rather than focusing on isolated symptoms, I emphasize restoring coherence and resilience across the whole person using a salutogenic (health-generating) approach.

Tools may include nutrition, micronutrient therapies, herbal medicine, lifestyle interventions, and — when appropriate — coordination with conventional treatments.

**Areas of Focus**\
I commonly work with:
- Chronic gastrointestinal concerns
- Nervous system dysregulation (anxiety, insomnia, mood-related conditions)
- Endocrine and metabolic imbalance
- Immune and inflammatory patterns
- Cardiovascular and respiratory issues
- Reproductive health
- Chronic musculoskeletal pain and complex multisystem conditions

For advanced or medically complex cases, I typically collaborate with your existing healthcare team.
