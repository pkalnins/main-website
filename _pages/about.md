I am an independent researcher, biomedical data scientist, and naturopathic physician focused on applying systems science and network physiology to understanding health, resilience, and chronic disease.
My work investigates how multi-organ physiological networks, clinical biomarkers, and real-world electronic health record (EHR) data can be integrated into practical models of whole-person health. I am particularly interested in translating complexity science into clinically meaningful frameworks that support prevention, recovery, and long-term resilience.

## Research Focus
My current research centers on:
- Organ-level physiological network modeling
- Computational analysis of EHR-derived clinical phenotypes
- Digital health and wearable data integration
- Systems approaches to metabolic and inflammatory disease
- Methods for identifying vulnerability and resilience across interconnected biological systems

I recently completed a two-year National Library of Medicine postdoctoral fellowship in bioinformatics and computational biomedicine at Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU), where my work focused on multimodal health data, predictive modeling, and systems biology.

Currently, I'm pursuing collaborative projects spanning clinical informatics, network medicine, and integrative health systems.

## Clinical & Educational Background
I earned my Doctorate in Naturopathic Medicine (ND) and Master of Science in Oriental Medicine (MSOM) from the National University of Natural Medicine (NUNM) in 1998. Following residency training in naturopathic primary care, I spent nearly two decades as an assistant professor at NUNM, teaching physiology, biochemistry, pathology, endocrinology, and herbal pharmacology, while serving as an attending physician in teaching clinics.

This extended clinical and teaching experience informs my research by grounding computational models in real-world patient care and longitudinal clinical patterns.

## Education & Training
My academic background includes early training in physics and mathematics, with additional studies in biology and philosophy. This interdisciplinary foundation continues to shape my approach to biological systems as dynamic, interconnected networks rather than isolated mechanisms.

In addition to formal graduate training, I have pursued ongoing education in biostatistics, evidence-based medicine, computer programming (Python, R, Javascript), machine/deep learning, and clinical research methods, and have mentored student-led clinical research projects.

## Integrative Perspective
My work is informed by both modern systems science and traditional medical frameworks, including East Asian and anthroposophical medicine. These perspectives emphasize pattern recognition, organism-level coherence, and the role of regulatory balance in health.

Rather than viewing these traditions as alternatives to biomedicine, I see them as complementary conceptual models that can help guide hypothesis generation and systems-level interpretation when paired with rigorous computational and clinical methods.
