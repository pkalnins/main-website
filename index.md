## Welcome

I’m **Paul Kalnins, ND, MS** — a licensed naturopathic physician, medical educator, and researcher based in Portland, Oregon.  

I have been in practice since 1998, offering **Telehealth consultations** for clients seeking complementary and integrative solutions to their health concerns.

My overarching focus is applying **systems and network science** to medicine—linking insights from modern biomedicine with traditional healing frameworks to better understand and support health. This approach informs all my work, whether in clinical care, teaching, or research.

## Philosophy: Salutogenic-Terrain Medicine

I believe that insights from modern biomedicine and more traditional medicines can inform one another, yielding new approaches to understanding health and disease.

In particular, I focus on addressing patterns of dysfunction in the endocrine (hormone), nervous, immune and organ systems using nutritional, micronutrient (minerals, vitamins, amino acids, fatty acids), and herbal therapies, together with conventional therapies, such as hormone replacement, when indicated.

My clinical philosophy is based on a Salutogenic-terrain approach to healing, which integrates both modern and traditional insights regarding health and disease.
