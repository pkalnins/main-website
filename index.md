## Welcome

I’m **Paul Kalnins, ND, MS** — a licensed naturopathic physician, educator, and researcher based in Portland, Oregon.

My work centers around a core inquiry: how can **systems science and network physiology** bridge traditional healing systems with modern biomedical insights?  

I explore this question through **patient care, research, mentorship, and writing** — integrating tools from clinical practice, digital health, and complexity science to support whole-person healing.
