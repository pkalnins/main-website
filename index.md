## Welcome

I’m **Paul Kalnins, ND, MS** — a licensed naturopathic physician, medical educator, and researcher based in Portland, Oregon.  

I have been in practice since 1998, offering **Telehealth consultations** for clients seeking complementary and integrative solutions to their health concerns.

My overarching focus is applying **systems and network science** to medicine—linking insights from modern biomedicine with traditional healing frameworks to better understand and support health. This approach informs all my work, whether in clinical care, teaching, or research.
